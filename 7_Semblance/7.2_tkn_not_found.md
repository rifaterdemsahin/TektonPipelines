It appears you're encountering two issues while working with Tekton Pipelines:

1. **Error: No objects passed to apply**: This error typically occurs when the `kubectl apply` command is executed without specifying any valid resource files. In your case, you ran:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply --filename /workspaces/TektonPipelines/6_Symbols/2_pipelines/pipelinerun-hello-world.yaml
   ```

   Ensure that the file path is correct and that the YAML file contains valid Kubernetes resource definitions. You can verify the file's content by opening it or using a command like `cat`:

   ```bash
   cat /workspaces/TektonPipelines/6_Symbols/2_pipelines/pipelinerun-hello-world.yaml
   ```

   If the file is valid and the path is correct, the command should apply the resources without error.

2. **Command not found: tkn**: The `tkn` command-line tool is part of the Tekton CLI, which provides utilities for interacting with Tekton resources. The error message indicates that `tkn` is not installed on your system. To install it, follow these steps:

   - **For Linux**:

     ```bash
     curl -LO https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases/download/v0.29.0/tkn_0.29.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
     tar xvzf tkn_0.29.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin tkn
     ```

   - **For macOS**:

     ```bash
     brew install tektoncd-cli
     ```

   After installation, verify that `tkn` is installed correctly by checking its version:

   ```bash
   tkn version
   ```

   Once installed, you should be able to retrieve the logs for your PipelineRun:

   ```bash
   tkn pipelinerun logs hello-world-pipelinerun -f
   ```

   If you continue to experience issues, ensure that your system's PATH includes the directory where `tkn` is installed, and that you have the necessary permissions to execute the binary.

If you need further assistance, feel free to provide more details about your environment or the specific errors you're encountering. 


---

The "Permission denied" error you're encountering when extracting `tkn` to `/usr/local/bin` suggests that your current user lacks the necessary permissions to write to that directory. This is common on Unix-like systems, where `/usr/local/bin` is typically owned by the `root` user and restricted to prevent unauthorized modifications.

To resolve this issue, you have a couple of options:

1. **Use `sudo` to extract the file with elevated privileges**:

   Prepend `sudo` to your `tar` command to execute it with superuser permissions:

   ```bash
   sudo tar xvzf tkn_0.29.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin tkn
   ```

   You'll be prompted to enter your password. This approach ensures that the extraction has the necessary permissions to write to `/usr/local/bin`.

2. **Extract to a directory within your user's PATH**:

   If you prefer not to use `sudo`, you can extract the `tkn` binary to a directory where your user has write permissions and which is included in your `PATH`, such as `~/bin`:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/bin
   tar xvzf tkn_0.29.0_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -C ~/bin tkn
   ```

   Ensure that `~/bin` is in your `PATH` by adding the following line to your shell's configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   After updating the configuration file, reload it with `source ~/.bashrc` (or the appropriate file for your shell).

**Verify the Installation**:

After extracting the `tkn` binary, confirm that it's executable and accessible:

```bash
tkn version
```


If the command returns the version information, the installation was successful.

**Alternative Installation via Package Manager**:

Alternatively, you can install the Tekton CLI using a package manager like `brew` (Homebrew):

```bash
brew install tektoncd-cli
```


This method manages the installation path and permissions automatically.

By following these steps, you should be able to install the `tkn` CLI without encountering permission issues.
