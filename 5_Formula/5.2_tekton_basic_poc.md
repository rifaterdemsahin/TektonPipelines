To create a basic proof of concept (PoC) using Tekton Pipelines, follow these steps:

1. **Install Tekton Pipelines**: Ensure that Tekton Pipelines is installed and running in your Kubernetes cluster. From your output, it appears that the Tekton components are running in the `tekton-pipelines` namespace.

2. **Define a Tekton Task**: A Task is a collection of steps that run sequentially to perform a specific build or deployment action. Create a YAML file named `task-hello-world.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Task
    metadata:
      name: hello-world
    spec:
      steps:
        - name: echo
          image: ubuntu
          script: |
            #!/usr/bin/env bash
            echo "Hello, World!"
    ```

3. **Apply the Task**: Apply the Task definition to your Kubernetes cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f /workspaces/TektonPipelines/6_Symbols/2_pipelines/task-hello-world.yaml
    ```

4. **Create a Tekton Pipeline**: A Pipeline defines the sequence of Tasks to be executed. Create a YAML file named `pipeline-hello-world.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: Pipeline
    metadata:
      name: hello-world-pipeline
    spec:
      tasks:
        - name: run-hello-world
          taskRef:
            name: hello-world
    ```

5. **Apply the Pipeline**: Apply the Pipeline definition to your Kubernetes cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f pipeline-hello-world.yaml
    ```

6. **Create a PipelineRun**: A PipelineRun triggers the execution of a Pipeline. Create a YAML file named `pipelinerun-hello-world.yaml` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
    kind: PipelineRun
    metadata:
      name: hello-world-pipelinerun
    spec:
      pipelineRef:
        name: hello-world-pipeline
    ```

7. **Apply the PipelineRun**: Apply the PipelineRun definition to your Kubernetes cluster:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f pipelinerun-hello-world.yaml
    ```

8. **Monitor the PipelineRun**: Monitor the status of the PipelineRun:

    ```bash
    tkn pipelinerun logs hello-world-pipelinerun -f
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use `kubectl` to check the status:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pipelineruns
    ```

This basic PoC sets up a Tekton Pipeline that runs a Task to print "Hello, World!" to the console. You can expand upon this by adding more complex Tasks and Pipelines to suit your project's needs.
